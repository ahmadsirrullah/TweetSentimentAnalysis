# TweetSentimentAnalysis
The issue of tourists in Bali negatively impacting Indonesia's tourism image has worsened. Since the reopening of tourism after the pandemic, many tourists have taken advantage of the government's leniency and openness to engage in activities that are not in line with the constitution or local customs.

In this regard, sentiment analysis of Twitter netizens is being conducted to assess the level of negativity towards Bali's tourism in the digital world, particularly on Twitter. The government and local tourism management can gain insights into making appropriate policies by understanding the concerns and criticisms expressed by Twitter users.

The complete workflow is available in the "Analysis of Bali Tourism Sentiment.pdf" file along with its results.

The code for the analysis can be found in the "code" folder, consisting of four files:

1. "Crawling Twitter.ipynb": Code for crawling Twitter data using the twint library.
2. "Preprocessing.ipynb": Code for preprocessing the tweets.
3. "Visualization.ipynb": Code for creating visualizations.
4. "Modelling_with_IndoBERTweet.ipynb": Code for modeling using the Neural Network IndoBERTweet.
5. 
The data from crawling and labeling can be found in the data folder.
